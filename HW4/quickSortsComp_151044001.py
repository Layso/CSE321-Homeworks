# The difference between lomuto and hoare partitioning is; hoare saerches
# the subarray from both sides with two indicators while on lomuto there is one
# indicator that shift while the other is still. In my opinion hoare is more
# simple to understand and implement easily. At least that was my thought after
# I first hear them on class. Both implementations are easy but still Hoare's
# algorithm is (for me) more convincing that it partitions a subarray with a
# random pivot. Also from the scientific approach according to my research;
# hoare will never do swap on a subarray that is already sorted, while lomuto
# does n/2 swaps. All same element arrays are another case. Hoare does swap
# but finds pivot in middle but lomuto have its worst case so it degrades the
# performance to Î˜(n^2). As I understand here using hoare has more advantages
# than lomuto. I tried to implement pseudeucode on our notebooks but somehow
# failed due to an infinite loop issue. I found a solution and rearrenged the
# implementation according to it by swapping smaller indicator and larger
# indicator shifts. See commented area above fn hoare for more clear description
